// creator.js file. This is the starting point for the widget creator. Like the player, it must implement a number of CreatorCore calls. Like the player, it can be written
// in pretty much any flavor of javascript you like.

Materia.CreatorCore.start({
	initNewWidget = (instance) => {

	},
	initExistingWidget = (title, instance, _qset, version, newWidget = false) => {
		
	}
})
